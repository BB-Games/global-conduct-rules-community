# global-conduct-rules-community

This repo stores and manages the global conduct rules for the community. The intention behind having it here is that the guidelines can be tracked and updated over time, as well as being able to stylistically control it in a much easier fashion.

Plus we can use GitHub Pages to host it for us ðŸ¤·

## About

This repo is based upon the svelte framework (https://svelte.dev/). While we don't really take advantage of Svelte in this repo it _is_ able to output static pages nicely so there's no real downside to using it compared to say, plain html.

## Contributing

Feel free to open discussions here via issues over what you think should be added or changed. If you want to make a change yourself, feel free to fork the repo and open a PR with your changes. We'll review it and merge it in if it's good to go.
